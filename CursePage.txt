You've seen the craters that Nuclear Reactors can cause. How one slip up can desolate your base.
Developing working technology was harder than anyone could have estimated. And yet, you are now
able to monitor your entire base; shut down reactors before they overheat and save the world from yourself!

Nuclear Control 2 is an addon mod to IC2, that allows for the monitoring of several block in the world.
Originally designed by Shedar to monitor and control IC2 Nuclear Reactors, the current team (Xbony2, dmf444 and Pyrolusite) have integrated with several other popular mods.

Panels can display information from block/multiblock. Normal Panels can connect and display info from one block.
The Advanced Info Panel has 3 card slots as well as can be angled and have the back colors changed. The remote monitor is capable of
connecting to one block and displaying the info.
